# miniAlphaGo-for-Reversi
Design of AI algorithm for Reversi

**Abstract:** With simple rules and interesting experience, Reversi is becoming a popular game all over the world. In recent years, with the development of artificial intelligence, more and more scholars try to apply artificial intelligence methods in Othello. In this project, we realized Reversi AI by using pure Monte Carlo tree search algorithm and neural network Monte Carlo tree search algorithm respectively. After training and parameter adjustment, our AI can pass the ZJU Mo platform test and achieve good results.
